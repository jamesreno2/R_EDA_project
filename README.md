R Exploratory Data Analysis Project on Austin Animal Center Data

This project was based on exploring the public data on intakes and outcomes of animals at Austin Animal Center (AAC).

I have personally seen Austin Animal Center send out urgent requests for help dealing with capacity issues. Where the shelter is inundated with pets and has run out of space. One of the goals of this project was to understand the volume of animals coming into the center and different characteristics that are common.

Austin promotes itself as a "no-kill" city referring to the "no-kill" animal shelter movement that started in the 80's. Because there is no standard way to calculate the metrics that govern the "no-kill" definition, I was also interested in exploring how Austin "qualifies" for this designation.

General Observations

Austin Animal Center has a large number of animals flowing through their facility. Unsurprisingly, the majority of these are dogs and cats. There are other categories that include wild animals such as bats, raccoons, etc. The livestock category included pigs, goats, sheep, but notably no horses or cows.

The outcomes of animals flowing through AAC were primarily adoptions, but were followed closely by a category named transfers. In fact, transfers in cats made up nearly the same number of animals as adoptions. However, the shelter's catch-neuter/spay-release program is included under this category which may inflate the numbers.

The number of transfers to partners was a substantial number of animals. Austin's local independent rescues play a vital role in keeping Austin Animal Center functional. Budgetary and planning in the future should prioritize liaisons to coordinate with these non-profits and support them however possible. Their existence is critical to the success of Austin Animal Center.

Future Directions

Correlating adoption rate or speed to adoption with the American Kennel Club's popularity score to see if more popular breeds are adopted more quickly. Additionally, an interesting infographic by David McCandless compared popularity to a feature they developed that encompassed intelligence, cost, longevity, and grooming requirements. Exploring if this feature relates to adoption rates would also be an interesting endeavor.
